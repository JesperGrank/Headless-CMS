# Project description 
This is a written guide on how to create a headless CMS project by using https://wordpress.com as your API. This project is built with React but you may swap that to whichever library suits you the best.

## 1: Setting up this project as a boilerplate

### 1.1: Fork or clone this project into chosen directory on your computer
### 1.2: Run `` npm install`` in your terminal
### 1.3: Add an " .env " file in the root catalog, that file should contain your [https://wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com) API URL.

### 1.4: Run ``npm start`` in your terminal and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see changes to your app.
### 1.5: You need a wordpress account for posting new blog posts. https://wordpress.com/learn/get-started/
### 1.6: Send your wordpress -Email or -Username to admin to get access to this CMS: jesper.grankvist@hotmail.com

## 2: Deploy via Vercel

### 2.1: Open [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in with your Github credentials
### 2.2: Import which repository you want to deploy and match the environment variables from your editor to the application
![Description of what fields to be filled in](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JesperGrank/headless-cms/main/descriptive-images/Deploy1.png)
### 2.3: Click deploy - enjoy coding.

Anytime you push or merge new code to your main branch, the deployed vercel application will be updated.

<!-- In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
